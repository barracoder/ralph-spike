## Codebase Patterns
- prd.json must be an object with `branchName` at root, not a plain array
- prd.json lives in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`

- Implemented comprehensive README with project overview, install instructions, and Ralph quickstart
- Files changed: README.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json (fixed structure)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD was initially a plain array - fixed to object with `branchName` at root per AGENTS.md gotcha
  - Current branch is `inital-setup` (note typo in branch name)

## 2026-01-16T00:23 - Story 1
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created Blazor WebAssembly project with .NET 8 in src/SpaceInvaders
- Added Blazor.Extensions.Canvas package (version 1.1.1)
- Verified build and run work (dev server on localhost:5041)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `dotnet new blazorwasm -n NAME -f net8.0 -o OUTPUT --no-https` for simple wasm project
  - Clean obj/bin before build if getting weird MSBuild errors
  - Port is configured in Properties/launchSettings.json (5041 by default)
