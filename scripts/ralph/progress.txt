## Codebase Patterns
- prd.json must be an object with `branchName` at root, not a plain array
- prd.json lives in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- SpaceInvaders dev server runs on http://localhost:5003 (configured in launchSettings.json)

---
- Server starts on localhost:5003 with `dotnet run`

## 2026-01-16T00:15 - Story 1 (Project setup)
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created Blazor WebAssembly project with .NET 8 using `dotnet new blazorwasm -n SpaceInvaders -f net8.0 --no-https`
- Added Blazor.Extensions.Canvas package v1.1.1
- Verified `dotnet build` succeeds and `dotnet run` starts dev server on http://localhost:5003
- Files changed: SpaceInvaders/ (new Blazor WASM project with 19 files)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This branch (ralph/space-invaders) was created fresh from inital-setup branch
  - Dev server uses port 5003 by default (configured in launchSettings.json)
  - Use `dotnet new blazorwasm --no-https` to avoid HTTPS complexity for local dev

## 2026-01-16T00:01 - Story 1
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented comprehensive README with project overview, install instructions, and Ralph quickstart
- Files changed: README.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json (fixed structure)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD was initially a plain array - fixed to object with `branchName` at root per AGENTS.md gotcha
  - Current branch is `inital-setup` (note typo in branch name)
