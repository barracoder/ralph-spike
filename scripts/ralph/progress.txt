## Codebase Patterns
- prd.json must be an object with `branchName` at root, not a plain array
- prd.json lives in `scripts/ralph/prd.json`

## 2026-01-16T00:01 - Story 1
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented comprehensive README with project overview, install instructions, and Ralph quickstart
- Files changed: README.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json (fixed structure)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PRD was initially a plain array - fixed to object with `branchName` at root per AGENTS.md gotcha
  - Current branch is `inital-setup` (note typo in branch name)
